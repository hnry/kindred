A chrome extension so you can...
use any editor / IDE for just about any editable web content.

for instance, use your own editor for codepen.io, wordpress, etc.
(kindred binds itself to codepen.io's editor or wordpress's editor )

A editor (or IDE) is a personal thing. You've taken the time to learn it, to customize it, on top of the overwhelming plugins you probably have to empower your editing. So what can beat it? No matter how advanced web editors are getting, nothing beats your own editor.


When you visit a website that kindred knows about, you open up your editor, start editing a file, and kindred will know to sync it. On the initial file (creation), kindred has some semi-automation to bind to the appropriate web site/form/editor with very little intervention. Afterwards its completely automated.

#### What editors and file formats are supported?

Any editor that saves files without any sort of encoding (plain text).
Though if there's enough interest for a certain file format, that may be added (but I can't imagine any at this time).


#### Why is there a slight delay and not in real time?

Having it be real time overcomplicates a lot of things. There's a trade off, some of the benefits and features of this extension get lost for a few less _milliseconds_. For instance, you can't just use any editor anymore, you need plugins for each editor.

And having it be X amount of _milliseconds_ faster doesn't really add much value (besides maybe looking cooler).

Again, _milliseconds_.
